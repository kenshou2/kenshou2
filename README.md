## Hi, I'm Andrii 👋

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** specializing in **React and TypeScript**, with a passion for building **production-ready, scalable, and visually polished web applications**.

**Tech Stack**  
My primary stack is **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.  
I also enjoy planning and designing projects in **Figma**, focusing on structure, usability, and clean layouts.

**Projects**  
I have worked on several projects, but my favorite one is a **Japanese language learning platform** — a large-scale web app with 10+ pages, complex user flows, API state management, and fully responsive design. Try it yourself: [Repository](https://github.com/kenshou2/react-japanese-learning-platform) · [Live Demo](https://kenshou2.github.io/react-japanese-learning-platform/)

**Languages**  
English — Fluent · Japanese — Intermediate (N4–N3) · Ukrainian, Russian — Native  
I'm actively learning Japanese and genuinely enjoy the process.

**About me**  
I’m deeply interested in Japan — its culture, mindset, and way of life.  
As a person and as an engineer, I value discipline, consistency, and quality, and I try to reflect that in everything I build.
